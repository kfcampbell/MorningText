# Idea
Create a script that will send the current M's starters (or whoever) as a text each morning.

# Usage
Will probably involve a cron job run each morning.

# Future ideas:
    * M's starters and game time.
    * Weather forecast for day (hardcoded location?)
    * Clean up into a class and make/call functions accordingly to reduce code bloat.
